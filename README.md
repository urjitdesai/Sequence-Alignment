# Sequence-Alignment
Traditional and Efficient Implementation of the Sequence Alignment Problem  

Traditional Approach- Dynamic Programming (sub.py)
Efficient Approach- Divide and Conquer Plus Dynamic Programming (ef.py)


# The program takes as input:
1. 2 strings that need to be aligned, should be generated from the string
generator mentioned above.
2. Gap penalty (δe).
3. Mismatch penalty (αpq)

# Output
Both the files output an "output.txt" file containing the following information:
1. The first 50 elements and the last 50 elements of the actual alignment.
2. The time it took to complete the entire solution.
3. Memory required

# Execution
run the commands:
python3 sub.py
python3 ef.py
